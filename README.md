## Summary

Gotta Jet seeks to provide useful information for travelers by consolidating 
multiple travel resources in one place.

Built with: HTML, CSS, Javascript, and jQuery
APIs used: Exchangeratesapi, Foursquare, Youtube, locationIQ, and Weatherbit

## Goals for Future Versions

Using a better API like fixer.io or openexchangerates.org that have more
expansive currency databases.

Adding an autocomplete dropdown feature for text inputs.

Adding an option for users to search for specific interests in the  
recommended places section and allowing the recommendations to refresh.

Adding a packing list that takes in the weather forecast information.
For example: 
High UV from week's forecast = bring sunglasses, hat, sunscreen
Max Temp >80 = bring shorts and tees, flip flops or sandals
Min Temp <35 = bring winter coat, boots, winter accessories
Probability of precipitation > 50% any day = bring umbrella, rainboots
